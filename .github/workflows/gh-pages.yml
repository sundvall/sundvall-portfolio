# https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/#branches-for-github-actions
# By default, the GitHub action pushes the generated content to the gh-pages branch. 
# This means GitHub has to serve your gh-pages branch as a GitHub Pages branch. 
# You can change this setting by going to Settings > GitHub Pages, and change 
# the source branch to gh-pages.
