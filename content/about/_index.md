Hi!:wave:  

<img class="shadow round square-150 block" src="/sundvall-portfolio/images/portrait.jpeg" caption="portrait" />

I'm a front-end developer and artist living in Stockholm, Sweden.

My backround is a mix of art and technology, with a history of both math, 3D-software and classical arts. Programming has always been present in some form, like attempts to create game for Amiga500 in programming language 'amos', and 'pascal' during higher education.

Since 2008 I've been working with commercial code projects. Among these are visualisation of traffic and a service for food-recipes. Since 2013 I've been part of several agile teams and experienced different blends of scrum, kanban and safe.

I have learnt javascript from books, collegues, online resources, blog posts, newsletters and more. I enjoy the creation and buildprocess of coding in itself and to constantly improve skills and knowledge. The latest time I've been fascinated by functional programming.

The most enjoyable situations are when there is a visual output from the code, thus making abstract information transform into something you can see or hear.

**Coding guiding stars, I believe ...**
- testdriven development creates better code. 
- pure functional declarative code simplifies maintenance.
- the best code is written in collaboration.
