Hi!:wave:  

<img class="shadow round square-150 block" src="/images/portrait.jpeg" caption="portrait" />

I'm a front-end developer and artist living in Stockholm, Sweden.

My backround is a mix of art and technology, with a history of both math, 3D-software and classical arts. Programming has always been present in some form, like attempts to create game for Amiga500 in programming language 'amos', and 'pascal' during higher education.

Since 2008 I've been working with commercial code projects. Among these are visualisation of traffic and a service for food-recipes. 

I'm self taught in javascript, and have learnt from books, collegues, online resources, blog posts, newsletters and more. 

Since 2013 I've been part of several agile teams and tried different approaches to its procedures of srum, kanban and mixes of these.
