At Kronofogden me and my crossfunctional team cream created application flows for logged in users. As an authority the requirements of accessability were very strict.  

Storybook was used to document and develop library components in isolation.

Angular framework was used together with Karma for testing, azure for api's, Ngrx for state management and scss together with bootstrap for styling.

As a team lead I facilitated upgrade of the angular framework and configured tools for development.


Challenges that the team handled:
- multipage sequences of forms
- session persistence over multipage navigation
- prefilled forms
- accessability (wcag 2.2)
