As an internal project me and my team implemented the design and flow to login with bank-id.

A technical flowchart was created from the given design and was used as a tool to early on discuss aspects of both ui and api-calls. This was used by the team during the entire project and proved to be very useful. Missing parts of the flow were discovered early on and logical improvements could be done before any coding was executed. 

Technical aspects that the team handled:
- short deadline
- single page application
- responsive styling
- temporary altenation of team
