As an internal project me and my team implemented the design and flow to login with bank-id.

I introduced the creation of a visual flowchart as one of the first tasks in the agile sprint. It was created from the given ux-design and included the navigation logic and network traffic. This became the gathering point to early discuss aspects of both ui and api-calls. It also simplifed communication outside the dev-team with stakeholders and testers. Missing parts of the flow were early discovered and logical improvements could be done before any coding was executed. 

**Experience:**
- short deadline
- single page application
- responsive styling
- temporary altenation of team
