Everything was done in pure javascript and css and reusability was improved by combinations of command line scripts and reusable functions.
The work included both legacy formats and new development for video and animated interactive content used for advertising. Many edge-cases occured when smartphones, native apps and browsers where combined. Most often the debugging was made with remote scripts.</description></item></channel></rss>
