I was leading the frontend development and focused on upgrades of the technical environment and improvements in developer experience, aside from implementing accessible forms. The environment was very restricted and provided many challenges to provide access to tooling that is in most circumstances are natural.
As an authority the requirements of accessability were very strict, and an external consultancy firm was engaged to evalutate the results.</description></item></channel></rss>
