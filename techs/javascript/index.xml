This was created in pure vanilla javascript and built upon the pre-redux solution of state management called &amp;lsquo;flux&amp;rsquo;. The main idéa was to separate management of data from rendering, and was solved with several &amp;lsquo;stores&amp;rsquo;. The dom-templates were handled by javascript.
When more developers joined and redux with react became popular. Thus the demand on communication grew and the application could be improved with conventional standards.</description></item></channel></rss>
