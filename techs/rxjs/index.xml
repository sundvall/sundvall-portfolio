A technical flowchart was created from the given design and was used as a tool to early on discuss aspects of both ui and api-calls. This was used by the team during the entire project and proved to be very useful. Missing parts of the flow were discovered early on and logical improvements could be done before any coding was executed.</description></item><item><title>kronofogden my pages</title><link>https://example.com/portfolio/kronofogden/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2019 19:47:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/portfolio/kronofogden/</guid><description>At Kronofogden me and my crossfunctional team cream created application flows for logged in users.
