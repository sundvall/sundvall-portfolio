This was created in pure vanilla javascript and built upon the pre-redux solution of state management called &amp;lsquo;flux&amp;rsquo;. The main idéa was to separate management of data from rendering, and was solved with several &amp;lsquo;stores&amp;rsquo;. The dom-templates were handled by javascript.
When more developers joined and redux with react became popular the first solution was transferred into this. During the rewrite the system was documented with flowcharts.</description></item></channel></rss>
