The components were created as webcomponents possible to use from cms (episerver), and integrated library components to provide consistency of appearance.
Storybook was used to document and develop library components in isolation.
Angular framework was used together with jest for testing, azure for api&amp;rsquo;s, Ngxs for state management and tailwind for styling.</description></item><item><title>Vattenfall electricity login flow</title><link>https://sundvall.github.io/sundvall-portfolio/portfolio/vattenfall-login/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 19:47:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sundvall.github.io/sundvall-portfolio/portfolio/vattenfall-login/</guid><description>As an internal project me and my team implemented the design and flow to login with bank-id.
A technical flowchart was created from the given design and was used as a tool to early on discuss aspects of both ui and api-calls. This was used by the team during the entire project and proved to be very useful. Missing parts of the flow were discovered early on and logical improvements could be done before any coding was executed.</description></item></channel></rss>
