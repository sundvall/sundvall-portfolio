The components were created as webcomponents possible to use from cms (episerver), and integrated library components to provide consistency of appearance.
Storybook was used to document and develop library components in isolation.
Angular framework was used together with jest for testing, azure for api&amp;rsquo;s, Ngxs for state management and tailwind for styling.
Strict adherence to naming conventions was helpful to maintain the codebase.</description></item><item><title>Vattenfall electricity login flow</title><link>https://sundvall.github.io/sundvall-portfolio/portfolio/vattenfall-login/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 May 2021 19:47:09 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sundvall.github.io/sundvall-portfolio/portfolio/vattenfall-login/</guid><description>As an internal project me and my team implemented the design and flow to login with bank-id.
I introduced the creation of a visual flowchart as one of the first tasks in the agile sprint. It was created from the given ux-design and included the navigation logic and network traffic. This became the gathering point to early discuss aspects of both ui and api-calls. It also simplifed communication outside the dev-team with stakeholders and testers.</description></item></channel></rss>
